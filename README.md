# IB-Computer-Science-IA

This is my IA for the class IB Computer Science HL.  

This is an application for Track and Field Management.  Athletes will be able to login and register/see the events they will run in and admins will be able to enter and register athletes into meets and their system.  All the times, meets, and results are recorded within a database which will then be accessed by the application itself. 

This application is currently under development and will be completed by the end of March
