# AthletePro
This is my IA for the class IB Computer Science HL.  This project scored 30/34 in the 2023 IB May examination session.

## Application Details
This is an application for Track and Field Management.  Athletes will be able to login and register/see the events they will run in and admins will be able to enter and register athletes into meets and their system.  All the times, meets, and results are recorded within a database which will then be accessed by the application itself. 

## Database Details
This application uses a local MySQL database in order to store all of the different meets, athletes, and times.  Using a MySQL database allows for secure and easy-storage system and can be easily accessed by the application itself.
